# search-savior

## What it does:
 - When toggled on, the extension will track tabs opened and save them into a tree structure. When toggled off, the tree will be saved in the projects page so that all webpages visited can be found again.

## How to test the extension:
  1. Open chrome://extensions in your chrome browser. In the upper left, toggle on developer mode
  2. In the top left of the page after developer mode is on, click "load unpacked" and upload the repository files
  3. Ater loading, the extension should appear on your extension page and in the browser's drop-down plug-in menu
  4. Hover over the extension's icon, which looks like a magnifying glass, the popout window should appear containing:
      - title: Search Savior
      - toggle on/off switch
      - link to saved projects page (page opens in new tab but is not complete)
